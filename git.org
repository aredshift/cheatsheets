** Note about parent revision selections in ZSH
Many git revision slections use the symbol ~^~ to resolve to the parent of the specified commit. ([[https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection][Docs]])

in ZSH you'll have to enclose strings with ~^~ in quotes if EXTENDED_GLOB is enabled.

For example, this command:
#+begin_src zsh
  git reset HEAD^
#+end_src

Will result in an error with the output: ~zsh: no matches found: HEAD^~

You can instead replace it with this command:

#+begin_src zsh
  git reset 'HEAD^'
#+end_src

Note the lack of double-quotes, which will be interpolated by ZSH.

You can check if the EXTENDED_GLOB option is enabled with the command:
#+begin_src zsh
  set -o | grep extendedglob
#+end_src

And can disable it like so:
#+begin_src zsh
  unsetopt extendedglob
#+end_src

** Revert a commit but keep the changes

#+begin_src bash
  git reset HEAD^
#+end_src
